Description
    ChartNotes is an application that lets you quickly write down ideas and tasks and then easily categorize those notes. A set of meta data is added along each line of notes that tracks thinks like start time, end time, category, etc. This meta data is the power of ChartNotes since from this information we then create all sorts of informative tools like burndown chart, flow charts, gant charts etc. 

    In a sence chart notes was created to replace Engineering notebooks, note tools (Trello, Monday, Gant chart). We also try to include a little bit of the power provided by notebooks by including flow charts witch is one of the most common forms of illustration when conceptualizing ideas.
